As a collaborative data science team at a leading New York City bank, we aim to build a predictive model to determine a customer's retirement readiness. Our analysis involves exploring essential customer data, including age and 401K savings, to better understand the key factors influencing retirement preparedness. Through statistical analysis, correlation assessments, SQL querying, and GPT-4 integration, we seek to derive actionable insights that will inform the development of an accurate predictive model.

    The dataset analysis reveals essential insights for predicting a customer's retirement status. Firstly, the average age of the customers is approximately 46.76 years, with a range from 25 to 70 years. Understanding the relationship between age and retirement readiness is pivotal, as it provides valuable insights into how different age groups may approach retirement planning. Additionally, the significant variability in 401K savings, indicated by the standard deviation of $187,675.82, highlights the diverse financial preparedness among customers. This suggests that individuals with higher savings may be better positioned for retirement, underlining the critical role of financial stability in retirement planning. 

    Moreover, the balanced distribution of retired and non-retired individuals within the dataset, as indicated by an equal representation of 0s and 1s in the 'Retire' feature, underscores the necessity of considering both groups when developing the predictive model. Ensuring that the model captures insights from both retired and non-retired individuals accurately is imperative for creating a comprehensive framework for predicting retirement readiness. By leveraging these key insights, a robust predictive model can be developed, taking into account the crucial factors of age, financial stability, and the overall distribution of retired and non-retired individuals in the dataset.

    The correlation matrix underscores essential relationships within the dataset. Firstly, the moderate positive correlation of 0.58 between 'Age' and '401K Savings' suggests that as a customer's age increases, their 401K savings tend to increase as well. This connection implies that older individuals are more likely to have higher retirement savings, emphasizing the importance of age in financial planning for retirement.

    Secondly, the strong positive correlation of 0.73 between 'Age' and 'Retire' suggests that as customers grow older, the probability of being retired increases. This correlation emphasizes the expected association between advancing age and the likelihood of retirement, reflecting the natural trend of transitioning into retirement as individuals age.

    Moreover, the substantial positive association of 0.78 between '401K Savings' and 'Retire' highlights the crucial role of financial preparedness in retirement. The correlation suggests that higher 401K savings are strongly linked to a higher likelihood of being retired, underlining the significance of adequate financial planning and stable retirement savings in ensuring a comfortable retirement.
